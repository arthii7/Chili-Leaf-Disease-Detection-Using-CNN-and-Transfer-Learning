    ChiliAid is your reliable partner for diagnosing diseases in chili leaves.
    
    Our state-of-the-art machine learning model accurately identifies diseases affecting chili plants. Upload a photo of a chili leaf on the **Disease Recognition** page, and we'll analyze the leaf and provide a diagnosis.

    ### How It Works:
    - **Take a Picture**: Get a clear photo of the chili leaf you want to examine.
    - **Upload the Image**: Submit the photo in the **Disease Recognition** page.
    - **Get Your Diagnosis**: Our model will analyze the image and give you a diagnosis.

    ### Get Started
