##Chili Leaf Disease Detection

Overview:
The Chili Leaf Disease Detection project aims to develop a system for automatically detecting diseases in chili plant leaves using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Plant diseases can have significant economic impact by reducing crop yield and quality. By providing early detection of diseases, this project aims to help farmers take proactive measures to mitigate the spread of diseases and protect their crop yield.

Key Features:
Dataset Collection: Gather a dataset of chili leaf images containing examples of healthy leaves as well as leaves affected by various diseases such as anthracnose, bacterial wilt, or powdery mildew.
Image Preprocessing: Preprocess the leaf images to enhance features relevant for disease detection, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.
Deep Learning Models: Train deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify chili leaves into healthy or diseased categories, and further classify diseased leaves into specific disease types.
Interpretability: Implement methods for visualizing and interpreting the predictions made by the model, such as heatmap visualization to highlight regions of interest indicative of disease presence.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of chili leaves and receive predictions about whether
